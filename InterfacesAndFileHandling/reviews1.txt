Takes
a
clunky
TV-movie
approach
to
detailing
a
chapter
in
the
life
of
the
celebrated
Irish
playwright
,
poet
and
drinker
.

Finally
coming
down
off
of
Miramax
's
deep
shelves
after
a
couple
of
aborted
attempts
,
Waking
Up
in
Reno
makes
a
strong
case
for
letting
sleeping
dogs
lie
.

Thanks
largely
to
Williams
,
all
the
interesting
developments
are
processed
in
60
minutes
--
the
rest
is
just
an
overexposed
waste
of
film
.

Comes
across
as
a
relic
from
a

its
convolutions

feel
silly
rather

Perhaps
it
's
cliche
to
call
the
film
`
refreshing

but
it
is

Both

Mark
Pellington
's
latest
pop
thriller
is
as
kooky
and
overeager
as
it
is
spooky
and
subtly
in
love
with
myth
.

Claude
Chabrol
's
camera
has
a
way
of
gently
swaying
back
and
forth
as
it
cradles
its
characters
,
veiling
tension
beneath
otherwise
tender
movements
.

Transforms
one
of

a
smart
new

The
screenplay
by
James
Eric
,
James
Horton
and
director
Peter
O'Fallon
...
is
so
pat
it
makes
your
teeth
hurt
.

But
arriving
at
a
particularly
dark
moment
in
history
,
it
offers
flickering
reminders
of
the
ties
that
bind
us
.
1
Its
generic
villains
lack
any
intrigue
-LRB-
other
than
their
funny
accents
-RRB-
and
the
action
scenes
are
poorly
delivered
.

The
characters
are
more
deeply
thought
through
than
in
most
`
right-thinking
'
films

The
film
,
despite
the
gratuitous
cinematic
distractions
impressed
upon
it

good

Downright
transparent
is
the
script
's
endless
assault
of
embarrassingly
ham-fisted
sex
jokes
that
reek
of
a
script
rewrite
designed
to
garner
the
film
a
``
cooler
''
PG-13
rating

A
smart
,
provocative
drama
that
does
the
nearly
impossible
:
It
gets
under
the
skin
of
a
man
we
only
know
as
an
evil
,
monstrous
lunatic
.

It
's
like
a
drive-by
.

is
many
things
--
stoner
midnight
flick
,
sci-fi
deconstruction
,
gay
fantasia
--
but
above
all
it
's
a
love
story
as
sanguine
as
its
title
.

A
very
funny
romantic
comedy
about
two
skittish
New

middle-agers
who
stumble
into
a
relationship
and
then
struggle
furiously
with
their
fears
and
foibles
.

But
it
has
an
ambition
to
say
something
about

but
not
a
willingness

-LRB-
Scherfig
-RRB-
has
made
a
movie

Reeks
of
rot
and
hack
work
from
start

.
1
Plays
like
a
series
of
vignettes

clips
of
a
film
that
are
still
looking
for
a
common
through-line

The
major
problem
with
Windtalkers
is
that
the
bulk
of
the
movie
centers
on
the
wrong
character
.
2
Swimfan
,
like
Fatal
Attraction
,
eventually
goes
overboard
with
a
loony
melodramatic
denouement
in
which
a
high
school
swimming
pool
substitutes
for
a
bathtub
.
1
This
is
a
heartfelt
story
...
it
just
is
n't
a
very
involving
one
.
4
An
unsettling
,
memorable
cinematic
experience
that
does
its
predecessors
proud
.
3
All
in
all
,
it
's
a
pretty
good
execution
of
a
story
that
's
a
lot
richer
than
the
ones
Hollywood
action
screenwriters
usually
come
up
with
on
their
own
.

Phillip
Noyce
and
all
of
his
actors
--
as
well
as
his
cinematographer
,
Christopher
Doyle
--
understand
the
delicate
forcefulness
of
Greene
's
prose
,
and
it
's
there
on
the
screen
in
their
version
of
The
Quiet
American
.

The
Pianist
lacks
the
quick
emotional
connections
of
Steven
Spielberg

Inventive

intoxicatingly
sexy

violent

self-indulgent

maddening

In

in

it

wonderful

It
shows
us
a
slice
of
life
that
's
very
different
from
our
own
and
yet
instantly
recognizable
.

Amid
the
shock
and
curiosity
factors
,
the
film
is
just
a
corny
examination
of
a
young
actress
trying
to
find
her
way
.
2
It
's
lazy
for
a
movie
to
avoid
solving
one
problem
by
trying
to
distract
us
with
the
solution
to
another
.

...
it
's
as
comprehensible
as
any
Dummies
guide
,
something
even
non-techies
can
enjoy
.
1
Entertains
not
so
much
because
of
its
music
or
comic
antics
,
but
through
the
perverse
pleasure
of
watching
Disney
scrape
the
bottom
of
its
own
cracker
barrel
.

``
Analyze
That
''
is
one
of
those
crass
,
contrived
sequels
that
not

fails

makes
you
second-guess
your
affection

Report

Does

there

It
's
not
